# Warehouse

Warehouse is an open source project which has been developed to learn Zend Framework 2. It is composed with five main functionalities:
* an inventory with available articles
* a manual in/out stock management
* a shopping list
* a recipes list with the ingredients based on articles referenced in the database
* a web service to download the shopping list on a mobile device. The apps (iOS) is in development and will be coming soon.

The user is invited to connect with credentials:
